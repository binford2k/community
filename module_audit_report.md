# Open Source Housekeeping Audit

Puppet's Open Source Stewards group conducts a regular audit of our public GitHub
namespace and our Puppet Forge namespace for modules and repositories that do not
meet our standards and policies. This report contains content which is out of
compliance and should be either removed or corrected.

Each section below describes expectations for a check and suggestions for remediating
the failure. Expand the list to see all the content that failed the check.

If a repository is no longer useful then remove it rather than working to make it
compliant.

* If anyone else might find practical use or learning opportunities, then bin
  the repository into the [Toy Chest](http://github.com/puppetlabs-toy-chest/)
  to mark it as adoptable.
* If the repository has no use to anyone, then simply delete it.

See `{not yet published}` for details about our housekeeping standards.

## GitHub: Module repositories missing support tier topic

<details>
<summary>
Modules in the Puppetlabs namespace have different support expectations. Each module
repository should have a topic identifying which support tier it falls into. The
following GitHub repositories are missing their support tier topics and should
have them added.

## Forge: Source field problem

<details>
<summary>
Our standards for the `source` key in `metadata.json` is to point to the HTML url
of the GitHub repository containing module source. The following Forge modules do
not match that expectation. Either the field could not be parsed, or it does not
point to a valid public repo within the org. Sometimes this happens when another
developer takes ownership of a module and the Forge page isn't updated to match.

Correct the field for any modules we own, and deprecate as appropriate any modules
we no longer own.
