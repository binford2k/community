# Puppet Community Trusted Contributors

The following GitHub users have outside collaborator status on one or more
repositories. This generally means that the user has Trusted Contributor status,
although some are here for historical reasons.

⚠️ We will soon tighten up access and outside contributors will either be removed
or inducted into the Trusted Contributors program.

Are you interested in participating in the program?
