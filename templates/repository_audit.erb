# Repository Housekeeping Audit

Puppet's Open Source Stewards group conducts a regular audit of our public GitHub
namespace and repositories that do not meet our standards and policies. This
report contains repositories which are out of compliance and should be either
removed or corrected. For example, we require `LICENSE` files and valid `CODEOWNERS`.

We strongly prefer the Apache 2.0 license. Please reach out to the Open Source
Stewards if you have questions or would like to use a different license.

This report helps to keep these files current, maintained, and correct. The most
common issues we see with `CODEOWNERS` files are malformed owner assignments and
incomplete coverage. The owners assignment should be `@puppetlabs/<team name>`.

We prefer team assignments, but you can also use an individual assignment if needed
as long as you make sure to keep it current. To ensure complete code coverage, we
recommend that you place a wildcard match (such as `* @puppetlabs/community-maintainers`)
as your first rule in the `CODEOWNERS` file.

If a repository is no longer useful then remove it rather than working to make it
compliant.

* If anyone else might find practical use or learning opportunities, then bin
  the repository into the [Toy Chest](http://github.com/puppetlabs-toy-chest/)
  to mark it as adoptable.
* If the repository has no use to anyone, then simply delete it.

See `{not yet published}` for details about our housekeeping standards.

## GitHub: Incomplete `CODEOWNERS` codepath coverage

The following GitHub repositories have unowned files.

## GitHub: Repositories without `CODEOWNERS`

## GitHub: Repositories with code owned by users

<details>
<summary>
The following GitHub repositories have code paths owned by users instead of
teams. This may not be a problem, but it does introduce organizational risk.
</summary>

<% userowned.each do |repo| -%>

<% if nolicense -%>
## GitHub: No `LICENSE` file

<details>
<summary>
The following GitHub repositories have no `LICENSE` file. To reduce confusion for
our customers and community, and to reduce our legal risk, all publicly accessible
repos should have a license.
</summary>

<% nolicense.each do |repo| -%>
