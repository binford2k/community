# 👋 Welcome!

We’re using Discussions as a place to connect with other members of our community. We hope that you:
  * Ask questions you’re wondering about.
  * Help solve problems other folks are having.
  * Engage with other community members.
  * Welcome others and are open-minded. Remember that this is a community we build together 💪.
  * Help you find the proper places to report issues on our projects

## 🗣️ Start talking with the _Discussions_ tab above.

Share your thoughs, ideas, and questions. Help each other solve problems. If you'd like other ways to engage, see the "connect with us box on https://www.puppet.com/community.

## 🎟️ Reporting issues

We have moved exclusively to GitHub Issues for reporting problems with any of our products. For open source products, you'll simply use their corresponding repositories. Some of the most common ones:
  * [Puppet](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet)
  * [Bolt](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt)
  * [Facter](https://github.com/puppetlabs/facter)
  * [PuppetDB](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetdb)
  * [Puppet Server](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetserver)
  * [Puppet Modules](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Amodule+org%3Apuppetlabs+fork%3Atrue&type=Repositories) (take note of the support status)

Some products, like Puppet Enterprise itself, are developed internally. These now have corresponding GitHub repositories that are currently only used for issue reporting.
  * [Puppet Forge](https://github.com/puppetlabs/forge_issues)
  * [Puppet Enterprise](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-enterprise_issues)
  * [CEM Modules](https://github.com/puppetlabs/cem_issues)

### 💡 Sharing ideas and product suggestions

Got an idea or suggestion about any of our products that doesn't quite fit into a bug report? Take a look at the _Ideas_ forums in the Discussions area. Here are some suggestions to help make your ideas more likely to be implemented:
  * ✅ Make your suggestion as complete and actionable as you can.
  * 💬 Share your ideas with peers so that we can see community demand for them.
  * 👍 Engage with other ideas and provide constructive feedback.
 
Remember that as much as we'd like to, we cannot take every suggestion or build every new idea. Focusing on doing fewer things better is how we build the tools that you love.

## 📊 Reporting dashboards

See the [`dashboards`](dashboards/) directory for various reporting dashboards. Most are there to help us improve our own OSS housekeeping, but you're welcome to observe. And some of the boards are for you; for example during the month of October the [Hacktoberfest board](dashboards/hacktoberfest.md) will populate with a list of our OSS repos participating and provide a list of pull requests that our engineers should prioritize so you get credit for them. These dashboards are generated weekly.
