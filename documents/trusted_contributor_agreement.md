## Trusted Contributor Agreement 

<sub>Version 1.0</sub>

*Thank you for your interest in sharing the maintenance burden of a Puppet project!*

Before participating, you will need to sign our [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/puppetlabs/).
If you have not already signed the CLA, then you will be prompted to do so when making your
first pull request. You will also be expected to follow the [Puppet Community Code of Conduct](https://puppet.com/community/community-guidelines/),
as with any other community participation. 

As a co-maintainer of one or more Supported Puppet modules, we are placing a large amount
of trust in you. We are setting the expectation to our paying customers that your contributions
and the pull requests you approve are high quality, supportable, and free from malicious
intent. We are also certifying that you are creating generalized features with the entire
community in mind rather than solving for your own specific use case. Trusted Contributor
status will be revoked if any of this trust is intentionally or egregiously violated. 

### This agreement grants the following abilities on the modules you've been approved for: 

1. The ability to review and merge pull requests. All merges will require +1 approval
   from a current member of Puppet's Content team or another Trusted Contributor. 
1. The ability to review and merge the automated release prep pull request. This must
   be approved by a current member of Puppet's Content team. 
1. The ability to trigger the automated module publishing job that will tag, build,
   and publish the module. 

### In exchange, we have the following expectations: 

1. You will be responsive to issues, PR comments, etc. We have no formal SLA defined, but
   in general we'd like @mentions or review comments to be acknowledged within a few days. 
1. You will not intentionally or egregiously commit code with malicious or misleading intent.
   This includes malware, bitcoin mining, nonconsensual telemetry, and any other functionality
   that is not within the scope of the module's specified purpose. 
1. You will follow good development hygiene and collaborate with the IAC team as needed. 
1. You will inform Puppet promptly if your ability to participate in this program changes. 

This agreement may be terminated and Trusted Contributor status revoked for excessive violations
of these expectations, following the same escalation path as the Code of Conduct. Likewise, you
may choose to terminate the agreement at any time for any reason. This agreement may be updated,
and all current members of the program will be notified of changes by email.
